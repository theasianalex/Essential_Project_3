                I believe that Art Brussels has endured over the years because it has succeeded in staying faithful to its distinctiveness as a discovery fair, reserving a large part of the fair to the most emerging talents (…).” In the year of Art Brussels’ 50th anniversary, the quote by the fair’s Managing Director Anne Vierstraete demonstrates its strong profile, which has attracted curious international collectors of all ages during the past 50 years. We talked to Anne Vierstraete about reaching a milestone, the fair’s close relation to the city of Brussels, and playing a pivotal role in Belgium’s rich and vibrant contemporary art scene that is said to have one of the highest number of collectors per capita in the world.
                <br>
                For our 50th anniversary, as it is our third year at the landmark site of Tour & Taxis, a former industrial site which is being gradually restored and which becomes more magnificent every year, we decided to make use of the outdoor exterior at the entrance to the fair. Visitors will be welcomed by an installation of eight monumental sculptures, featuring both renowned artists and emerging talents, among which Bernd Lohaus, Bernard Pagès, Karl Philips, Bernar Venet and Henk Visch. Art Brussels’ artistic projects are illustrative of the fair’s integration with the Belgian artistic scene. This is why inside the fair and next to the gallery displays, we will show our flagship artistic project which reflects on a long-term collaboration with HISK (Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Ghent). The exhibition Mystic Properties, under the lead of esteemed curator Elena Sorokina (curator for the HISK), will present contemporary works by about 30 international artists dialoguing with the turbulent history of the ‘Adoration of the Mystic Lamb’, the widely recognised Ghent altarpiece painted in 1432 by the brothers Jan and Hubert Van Eyck. Many of the ideas around the paradoxes of owning and exhibiting art in the present day, addressed among other themes by the exhibition concept, are especially interesting to be developed within the context of a fair as the ownership of art grows increasingly disconnected from putting it on display and making it accessible to the public. Within the participants are several generations of the HISK residents, including prominent artists such as Pieter Vermeersch, the award-winning film maker Nicolas Provost and young prodigies Rinus Van de Velde, Kasper Bosmans and Hedwig Houben; as well as artists such as Almudena Lobera, Wesley Meuris, Philip Metten, Maarten Vanden Eynde, Vermeir & Heiremans, Ella Littwitz, Michiel Alberts, Cadine Navarro, Pedro Moraes, Raffaella Crispino, Ola Lanko, Annie Vigier and Franck Apertet (les gens d’Uterpan) among others.
