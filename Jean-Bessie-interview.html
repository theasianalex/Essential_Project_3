                Could you tell us a little about yourself?
            </h3>
            <div class="text p-Jean">
                <p>I'm a London based painter specialising in abstract and street photography.</p>
                
                <p>I'm best known for using a bold palette to help illustrate the vibrancy of life, 
                    whilst also exploring themes of diversity and disparity. My work often enters
                    into abstraction and presents the viewer with an unfamiliar view of a 
                    familiar city.
                </p>
                
                <p>I host regular painting workshops in London and sell limited art prints to fine
                    art collectors, enthusiasts, companies and interior designers around 
                    the world.
                </p>
                
                <p>Alongside my personal work, I deliver advisory services to clients such as 
                    Google, Apple, Hendrick’s Gin, Monkey Shoulder and Bacardi. I enjoy 
                    working closely with direct clients and creative agencies through every stage 
                    of the process, turning ideas into reality.
                </p>

            <h3 class="inter-question">
                Could you tell us about your works. what meanings do you put into them? Is there a hidden meaning in your works that the viewer probably will not see?
            </h3>
                <p class="text p-Jean">
                    My work interweaves figurative painting with a combination of abstract expressionism, geometric abstraction, and conventions of the painted still-life. The concept is created digitally on the computer and then projected onto the canvas. The ‘physical’ painting gives the illusion that they are digital. The work therefore works in polarities: analog and post-analog mark-making; feminine and masculine; pragmatism and Romanticism; expressiveness and obfuscation; light and dark.

            <h3 class="inter-question">
                What is the value of inspiration in creating a new work or series of paintings for you?
            </h3>
                <p class="text p-Jean">
                    I find inspiration in experimentation. Usually when I start a show or a series of new paintings, I allow myself a week or two of going into the studio with the intentions of failing. I think curiosity keeps me motivated and inspired. Discovering new ways of approaching my work is by far the most rewarding part of doing what I do.

                    My prediction is that I will live until 86. SEE YOU TOMORROW.
