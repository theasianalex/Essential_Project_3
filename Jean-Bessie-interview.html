                    I'm a London based painter specialising in abstract and street photography.
                    <br>
                    I'm best known for using a bold palette to help illustrate the vibrancy of life, 
                    whilst also exploring themes of diversity and disparity. My work often enters
                    into abstraction and presents the viewer with an unfamiliar view of a 
                    familiar city.
                    <br>
                    I host regular painting workshops in London and sell limited art prints to fine
                    art collectors, enthusiasts, companies and interior designers around 
                    the world.
                    <br>
                    Alongside my personal work, I deliver advisory services to clients such as 
                    Google, Apple, Hendrickâ€™s Gin, Monkey Shoulder and Bacardi. I enjoy 
                    working closely with direct clients and creative agencies through every stage 
                    of the process, turning ideas into reality.
